PSD to HTML conversion is a quick way to add interactive features into the static image files. 

First, you create the designs in Photoshop, a popular image editing tool. Then, convert them into HTML format. Slicing images from a PSD is not a new thing in the digital arena of today. But, the thing that matters is to do it smartly for effective results.

One can use different approaches including self-coding, automated tools, or hiring a dedicated expert from a reliable web development company. This will help accomplish this process in the most professional manner.
